**Location**: Route 209

**Conditions**: Grand Underground Interactions

If you find an Odd Keystone, either through the Grand Underground or otherwise, you can place it in the mysterious cumbled Hallowed Tower in Route 209. From there, if you interact with NPCs in the Grand Underground, it will build the energy to unleash Spiritomb. You need to have interacted with 32 different people in order to get Spiritomb. When you interact with the Hallowed Tower before then, you will get a message which can indicate how close you are

- **0-7 people**: "It appears to have been built many years ago."
- **8-14 people**: "Its stones appear to have shifted..."
- **15-21 people**: "...Is that crying coming from inside the tower?"
- **22-28 people**: "Is the tower shaking ever so slightly?"
- **29-31 people**: "There is some sort of presence... It appears ready to emerge!"

After you have the National Pokédex, if you go to the Old Chateau, if you go to it at night and interact with the TV in one of the rooms on the second floor, you will be able to get the Pokémon Rotom.

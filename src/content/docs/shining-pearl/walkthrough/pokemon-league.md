## How to Prepare

You're going to need to have a well-balanced party and lots of items. Your Pokémon should be _at least_ Level 55 with your heavy hitters at Levels 58-65. You'll have to face each trainer, one after another, healing as you go.

One thing to keep in mind, also — all of the trainers will use _at least_ one **Full Restore** in battle.

(One more word of advice: equip each Pokémon with your best HP-healing Berries so you don't waste precious turns with any healing). One thing to keep in mind, also — all of the trainers will use _at least_ one **Full Restore** in battle.

## Walkthrough

To access the main building in the area, simply head north, use **Surf,** then use **Waterfall**, and proceed into the building.

Now, you'll soon find that being successful at the Pokémon League is all about preparation. Start here by going to the left side to heal all of your Pokémon and going to the right side of the building and buying all of the items you need.

Before you head through the door, **Barry** will come barging into the Bug-type Pokémon League room to put up his last stand against you. As the battle begins, Barry will toss a **Level 48** [**Staraptor**](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Staraptor "Staraptor"), a **Level 49 Pokémon (**[**Rapidash**](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Rapidash "Rapidash")**,** [**Roserade**](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Roserade "Roserade") **or** [**Floatzel**](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Floatzel "Floatzel")**)**, another **Level 49 Pokémon (**[**Rapidash**](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Rapidash "Rapidash")**,** [**Roserade**](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Roserade "Roserade") **or** [**Floatzel**](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Floatzel "Floatzel")**)**, a **Level 50** [**Heracross**](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Heracross "Heracross"), a **Level 51** [**Snorlax**](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Snorlax "Snorlax") and last, but most definitely not least, his superstar, which would his **Level 53 starter Pokémon** picked at the beginning of the game.

After battling your friend for the last time near the north end of the small room, you'll have access to the League rooms where the great masters of the land are waiting for you to challenge them. Not only will you have to battle their Pokémon, all five battles, with the same Pokémon which you cannot switch nor bring to a Pokémon Center to heal, but you'll only have an opportunity to heal your Pokémon with the items you previously bought.

First up is **Elite Four Aaron** and his five Pokémon mainly of the Bug type. Staraptor or any Flying or Fire Pokémon can really do damage here.

On deck and up second is **Elite Four Bertha**. Bertha's array of Pokémon have a common weakness since they're all Rock or Ground-based. You can call on a high-end Water-Type Pokémon, such as [Gyarados](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Gyarados "Gyarados") to do a lot of damage here. Be ready to heal here if necessary, and don't let your Grass-type die here (if you're using one), because it will really give you a major edge in this battle.

Coming up third is **Elite Four Flint** and his group of Fire Pokémon. With two Fire-type Pokémon and a Steel-type in his party, [Gyarados](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Gyarados "Gyarados") and its two uber-powerful Water attacks in Surf and Waterfall would be a good idea. Another good call would be a strong, versatile Ground-Type Pokémon, such as [Garchomp](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Garchomp "Garchomp").

For the fourth and final Elite Four representative, you'll dual **Elite Four Lucian**. All four of Lucian's Pokémon are Psychic type, so use [Palkia](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Palkia "Palkia") or [Dialga](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Dialga "Dialga") here. Lucian will begin with [Mr. Mime](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Mr._Mime "Mr. Mime"). The biggest challenge he'll throw at you is his level 63 [Bronzong](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Bronzong "Bronzong"), who is not only a hard hitter but impervious to many attacks. Here, it's best to come at it with an [Infernape](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Infernape "Infernape"), or another high-end Fire Pokémon. As for the [Medicham](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Medicham "Medicham"), [Alakazam](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Alakazam "Alakazam") and [Girafirig](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Girafirig "Girafirig (page does not exist)"), you're going to want to use your Dialga/Palkia. It's best to have many **Full Restores, Revives, Max Potions** and **Full Heals** on hand.

And finally, we come to **Champion Cynthia**. Unlike her Elite Four cohorts, Cynthia won't come to battle with five Pokémon but instead, she has six ultra-powerful Pokémon. Her party is as well-mixed as yours should be.

She will begin with a [Spiritomb](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Spiritomb "Spiritomb"), so use strong Pokémon that can take a lot of hits, such as your own [Garchomp](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Garchomp "Garchomp") or [Dialga](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Dialga "Dialga")/[Palkia](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Palkia "Palkia"). Cynthia will use **Full Restores** liberally. Keep your party as well-healed as you can and try to bring out Pokémon that you think will do well against her set-up as needed. [Spiritomb](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Spiritomb "Spiritomb") will always come out at you first, but after that, it varies. Keep an eye out for the level 66 [Garchamp](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Garchamp "Garchamp (page does not exist)"). The best way to handle it is with a high-leveled [Gyarados](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Gyarados "Gyarados"), as it is one of the few Pokémon that can handle the hits from her [Garchomp](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Garchomp "Garchomp") and be able to deal exceptional damage against it. Surf it, Hydro Pump it, do whatever you can to get it down to a low HP.

Once her [Garchomp](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Garchomp "Garchomp") falls, the rest of the battle becomes much easier, as you can use your Luxray against her [Milotic](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Milotic "Milotic"), an [Infernape](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Infernape "Infernape") or strong Fire Pokémon against her [Roserade](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Roserade "Roserade") and your [Staraptor](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Staraptor "Staraptor") against her [Medicham](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Medicham "Medicham"). Lastly, use a strong Ground-type against her [Lucario](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Lucario "Lucario"). When her last Pokémon falls, you've finally done it!

When Champion Cynthia is defeated, you become the new Pokémon Champion! And just like that, the main quest is over. After watching and enjoying the ending (making sure the game automatically saves your quest for you at the end before shutting it off), you'll soon find there's much more to do. Check out the Side Quests section in this very guide for more on what you can do after the Pokémon Championship is yours.

Congrats to you and your team, you are now officially a Pokémon Master.

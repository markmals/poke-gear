Stark Mountain is in the northeast of the Battle Zone - head inside to team up with Buck while exploring.

Assisting him will allow Buck to take the Magma Stone, but you can talk to him once more in the Survival Area, and he'll return the Magma Stone to its original location.

Once you've done these steps, return once more to the innermost chamber of Stark Mountain to capture Heatran. Don't forget to save beforehand!

## Battle Barry One More Time

By completing the event of Stark Mountain, you can finally end the rivalry between you and Barry. You can head back to the Fight Area, where Barry will challenge you for the last time. **Keep in mind that you can only battle him on the weekend.**

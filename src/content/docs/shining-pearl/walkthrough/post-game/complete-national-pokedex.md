title: Complete the National Pokedex
---

Completing the National Pokedex should come as no surprise, but catching all 493 Pokemon is the endgame in Pokemon BDSP. Though Shaymin, Darkrai, and Arceus are currently unavailable (Shaymin is catchable via a glitch), the rest of the 490 is obtainable through legitimate ways in the game.

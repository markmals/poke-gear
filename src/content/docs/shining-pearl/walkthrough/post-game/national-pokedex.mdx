One of the first things you want to do after defeating Cynthia is to see the first 145 Sinnoh Pokémon — you might've seen the majority of them if you've been battling all trainers since the beginning of the game. If you're missing several Pokémon, use our Sinnoh Pokedex page as a guide to their location. Drifloon is a common missing one, as are the Lake Guardians mentioned above.

For the opposite Box Legendary Pokémon (Palkia for Brilliant Diamond and Dialga for Shining Pearl), you can unlock their Pokedex data by speaking to the Celestic Town Elder.

Once you've seen all 145 Pokémon, go back to Sandgem Town and speak to Professor Rowan inside the Pokémon Research Lab—this will trigger a conversation with Professor Oak. He'll upgrade your current Pokedex into the National Pokedex. You'll also receive the Poke Radar as a bonus!

<Aside type="note" title="How to Use the Poke Radar">

The Poke Radar is a Key Item you need to equip to use, like the Bicycle for example, which will then show shaking grass. See Poke Radar Pokémon to see all the Pokémon exclusive to this method and more information.

Remember the trio of Legendary Pokémon Team Galactic captured to create the Red Chain? Now that you've freed them, they've returned to their corresponding lake and are available for capture - though you technically could have done this before taking on the Elite Four.

You can find Uxie in the Acuity Cavern of Lake Acuity, Azelf in Valor Cavern of Lake Valor, and Mesprit in Verity Cavern of Lake Verity. The latter, however, will flee and roam the region when encountered.

## How to Catch Mesprit

Mesprit is a Legendary Pokémon in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl that's trickier to capture than its Lake Guardian counterparts Uxie and Azelf. Here's how to get Mesprit in Pokémon BDSP, what happens if Mesprit gets knocked out, and more.

Mesprit can be caught if you follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Ascend to Spear Pillar (part of Mt. Coronet) for the Story.
1. Once complete, you can Surf to Verity Cavern in the center of Lake Verity.
1. Interact with Mesprit inside the cavern - it will begin to "roam" Sinnoh.
1. Get the Marking Map Poketch App
1. Track Mesprit with the App while moving in and out of an area to make it move until it appears near you.
1. Use a Repel and head into the grass with a Pokémon Lv. 50 or lower to encounter Mesprit.
1. Catch Mesprit - Keep reading for additional instructions

</Steps>

Once you've completed the mission at Mt. Coronet's Spear Pillar with your first Legendary Pokémon, you can revisit the three main lakes in Sinnoh. Fly to Twinleaf Town, head north then left to Lake Verity to find Mesprit.

Use Surf to travel to a small island just offshore, and head inside to Verity Cavern. Within, just like with Uxie and Azelf, you will find Mesprit sitting there, but when you examine it, it will disappear instead of engaging you in battle.

At this point, if you simply wanted to fill out your Pokedex, then you can move on. By seeing Mesprit here at Verity Cavern, it will show up as "seen" in your Pokedex. If you want to capture the Pokémon, however, then read on.

The Professor will show up on the scene and tell you that Mesprit looked like he just wanted to play with you, and suggests using your Poketch to find it. Mesprit will now be "roaming" around Sinnoh, popping up in a different spot each time you change locations yourself.

### Where to Get the Marking Map Poketch App

Professor Rowan specifically mentions the Marking Map application.

If you don't have it, visit Jubilife City, head into Poketch HQ in the northwest, and talk to the founder standing next to the reception desk.

When you have it, take a look at it - an icon that looks like a face will appear noting Mesprit's location (see it in the bottom right in the screenshot below)

### Prepare to Catch Mesprit

Now that you can find Mesprit, you should first prepare. Keep in mind Mesprit, as long as it's not knocked out, will retain all status conditions and health between encounters after it runs.

- Stock up on Repels
- Have a Pokémon Lv. 50 or below at the head of your party
- Have Pokémon with Mean Look, a Status Condition move like Thunder Wave to increase its catch rate, and False Swipe.

<Aside type="note" title="Preferred Pokémon to Catch Mesprit">

Unfortunately, there are no Pokémon that learn all the suggested moves.

- **Murkrow** and **Misdreavus** both learn Mean Look and can also learn Thunder Wave via TM, but this can only be found from a random seller in the Grand Underground, or post-game with battle points. Murkrow is invulnerable to Mesprit's attacks and Misdreavus is resistant.
- **Luxray** learns Thunder Wave naturally.
- False Swipe is useful to deal damage without risk of killing it - it guarantees the Pokémon will remain with at least 1 HP. **Sneasel** is a good choice here because of its Dark-typing. Scyther and Scizor can do the job, too.

</Aside>

- Buy lots of Ultra Balls
- Alternatively, Mesprit is a great candidate for the Master Ball. Cresselia, another Legendary Pokémon that roams, could be an alternate choice.

With preparations complete, it's time to find and catch Mesprit.

### How to Find and Catch Mesprit

Each time you change location, so does Mesprit. Now that you have the Marking Map Poketch App, you can track Mesprit as it moves around Sinnoh. Chasing it isn't really efficient, and if you Fly, it will change locations anyway.

Because of this, you'll want to go to an area that has tall grass in both adjacent areas and move between these areas until Mesprit shows up where you are. **We recommend heading to Valley Windworks and Route 205**. Here are the step-by-step instructions to encounter and catch Mesprit from this point.

1. Fly to Floaroma Town
1. Go east to where Route 205 transitions to Valley Windworks
1. Run back and forth between the two areas with the Marking Map app up. Keep an eye on where Mesprit is.
1. When Mesprit appears in the area you are in, save your game. (It's on Route 205 in the screenshot of the minimap below)

1. Use a Repel and head into the grass with a Lv. 50 or below Pokémon at the head of your party (this guarantees the Pokémon you'll run into will be Mesprit.)
1. If you're using a Master Ball, simply chuck it at Mesprit after you run into it. If otherwise:

1. For your first encounter, you should put your Thunder Wave user at the head of your party. Use Thunder Wave on Mesprit - this lowers its speed and increases your catch rate.
1. Mesprit will likely run immediately, but attack if you can. Once it runs, repeat Steps 3-5.
1. On your second encounter, put the Pokémon with Mean Look at the head of your party (it should still be level 50 or below). Use this move when you encounter Mesprit next. **Keep in mind Mean Look's effects will be nullified if this Pokémon switches out.**
1. Now, whittle its health down without killing it after having used Mean Look.

1. Switch to False Swipe to avoid killing it.
1. Once Mesprit is Paralyzed with very little health, it's time to put your Mean Look Pokémon at the front of your party, use Mean Look, and toss Ultra Balls at it until it's caught.

<Aside type="caution" title="What if Mesprit is Knocked Out?">

If Mesprit is knocked out, or if you run, Mesprit will no longer be around — for now. Don't worry, it will respawn each time you defeat the Elite Four!

After defeating the Elite Four, Barry will call you to meet with him at the Fight Zone. You can do this immediately, but you won't be able to do anything there except the Battle Tower without the National Pokedex first.

The Fight Zone is an area north of the Pokemon League accessible by taking a boat in Snowpoint City. Talk to the sailor on the southernmost section of the city, and he'll take you to the Fight Areaâ€”the home of the Battle Park and the Battle Tower.

The Battle Tower is also a great place to hone your skills. Defeating 100 trainers in a row in the Single Battle category will increase your Trainer Card level.

The Razor Fang is a held item that increases crit chance, but it also evolves Gligar into Gliscor. Get one for free on the ground at the Battle Park, or earn 5BP at the Battle Tower to buy one.

Inside the Battle Tower, you can speak to the scientist NPC to the right of the ground floor to receive the Judge function; you'll need this to find out the Individual Values (IVs) of your Pokemon.

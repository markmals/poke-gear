- The Resort Area has an exclusive area only open to those with a Pokemon with three ribbons - earned by competing in Super Contests. Enter to get a Massage that greatly increases Friendship
- A Move Tutor is inside a house on Route 228 and will teach the final evolutions of the Starter Pokemon new powerful moves (basically elemental equivalents of Hyper Beam).
- There are more TMs and other items scattered about and given by NPCs!

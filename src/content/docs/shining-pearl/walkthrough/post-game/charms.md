There are a few things to get at Hotel Grand Lake,found between Route 213 and Lake Valor (see the image above). Head inside the building - a pool is out front - and talk to the Game Director upon seeing every Pokemon in the Sinnoh Pokedex. **He'll give you a Catching Charm, which increases the chance you'll get an immediate critical capture.**

### Unlock DS Sounds

Inside the same building, talk to the man with the guitar to unlock the original DS sound effects. Turn it on by flipping the switch on from the Key Items pouch.

GAME FREAK's Morimoto can be found just outside the Hotel Grand Lake building, swimming in the pool. He's one of the most challenging post game trainers in the game, and will fight you as soon as you've entered the Hall of Fame. **Defeat Morimoto to get the Oval Charm**, a Key Item that increases the chance of an Egg being found at the Pokemon Day Care in Solaceon Town.

He is arguably stronger than Cynthia, with a team comprised of the following Pokemon.

- Spiritomb (Lv.63)
- Ambipom (Lv.64)
- Hippowdon (Lv.64)
- Vaporeon (Lv.65)
- Jolteon (Lv.65)
- Flareon (Lv.65)

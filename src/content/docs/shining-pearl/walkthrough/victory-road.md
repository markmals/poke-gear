| [Floatzel](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Floatzel "Floatzel") | Cave   |        |
| [Golbat](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Golbat "Golbat")       | Cave   |        |
| [Graveler](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Graveler "Graveler") | Cave   |        |

| [Machoke](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Machoke "Machoke")    | Cave   |        |
| [Medicham](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Medicham "Medicham") | Cave   |        |

| [Steelix](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Steelix "Steelix")    | Cave   |        |

Entering the cave will bring you to Victory Road, the final area of the game before you take on the best trainers in the world at [The Pokémon League](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/The_Pokemon_League "The Pokémon League"), which is just on the other side of the cave. Bring healing items and **Escape Ropes** with you, that way your party is never in any real danger outside of battle.

There are a plethora of items on Victory Road, and a load of trainers too! (Just as a friendly reminder, make sure you have Pokémon with you that, all together, know _all_ of your HMs (minus any optional ones, like Defog). As you begin, head north over the wooden bridge. On the other side, use Rock Climb to go down to the area below. Head to your left once down here to fight the first trainer in the area—Psychic Bryce and his three Pokémon: a level 43 [Haunter](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Haunter "Haunter"), a level 46 [Gengar](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Gengar "Gengar"), and a level 46 [Alakazam](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Alakazam "Alakazam")—and then go north from him to get **TM41**, which will teach a Pokémon the move Torment.

Then, head to the right, past where we came down here. Search the far rock to find an **Ultra Ball**. Then, use Rock Climb to climb back up to the main area above, and then head eastward along the next bridge.

On this platform, take the stairs downward and circle around to cross the bridge to the north to grab the **Full Heal** sitting there, and then battle Bird Keeper Sana and her two Pokémon: a level 46 [Noctowl](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Noctowl "Noctowl") and a level 48 [Staraptor](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Staraptor "Staraptor"). Backtrack to the staircase, climb it, and go north over another bridge. Use Rock Climb to climb back down to the area below yet again. Then, carefully traverse the path heading left (making sure to not jump down to areas below that will cut you off from your route and force you to backtrack and do it all over again). Continue north and battle Ace Trainer Mariah and her team of a level 46 [Golduck](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Golduck "Golduck") and a level 48 [Blissey](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Blissey "Blissey"). When you reach a staircase on the far left end of this room, go up the stairs.

After climbing the stairs, head north to battle another trainer, and then go north all the way and inspect the rock to find a **Max Elixir**. Go down south a little and then use the stairs to your left to climb up once more, and go through the door.

This will lead you to another part of the cave. Here, you will need to use Rock Smash and Strength, so be ready with both of those. Start by smashing and pushing your way leftward. You'll need to utilize your Bicycle at this point to jump over the obstacles using the ramp made of a stone. Then, turn around, head right, and do the same thing. This will eventually lead a path northward and westward to a **Max Ether**. After adding that to your inventory, backtrack towards the entrance to this room, and this time, go south. Use Strength to push your way southward, and then head east to fight Ace Trainer Omar, and his trio of Pokémon: a level 45 [Rapidash](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Rapidash "Rapidash"), a level 45 [Carnivine](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Carnivine "Carnivine"), and a level 48 [Rampardos](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Rampardos "Rampardos").

Look at the rocks to your south that you need to use Strength on. If you do it wrong, and the rocks are pushed out of place, you'll need to head to the previous area and back again to reset their positions. What you need to do here is push the rock on the left down once, then circle around to the breakable rock below. Smash it, then push the same rock you just pushed down back up, and work your way through to the right. Push your way through yet again and fight a couple of more trainers. The first being Ace Trainer and her level 46 [Clefable](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Clefable "Clefable") and level 48 [Torterra](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Torterra "Torterra"). Continue to the east and then north. The area where you fight the second trainer: Veteran Clayton. He will battle with a level 47 [Staraptor](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Staraptor "Staraptor") and level 47 [Hippowdon](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Hippowdon "Hippowdon"). Go down the stairs nearby and then come back up. This will reset the rocks below so you can re-push them (just push the middle one down), giving you access to the secret area to your right.

Push the first boulder to the far right. Head up through the path and push the northern most boulder left. Use **Rock Smash** on the rock and then push the boulder south out of your way. You'll again need to break out your Bicycle to get through this area with any success. Head north and hop on the stones using your bike to grab a **Full Restore**. Head back north-east to battle Double Team Kay and Al. They will use a level 47 [Whiscash](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Whiscash "Whiscash") and leve 47 [Staraptor](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Staraptor "Staraptor"). Hop back on your bike after the battle and hop the stones again. This is where **TM71 Stone Edge**can be found, while on the left side, you can grab a **Full Restore**. With both of those in hand, you can then backtrack to the next area via the staircase by the aforementioned Veteran Clayton.

Go east across the bridge. Rock Climb down and follow it around to the next trainer battle with Black Belt Miles and his level 49 [Machamp](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Machamp "Machamp"). Continue to the east and take the next set of stairs. You'll need to use surf here to cross the bodies of water. Head towards the trainer to battle her. Psychic Valencia will use a level 44 [Chingling](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Chingling "Chingling") and level 48 [Chimecho](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Chimecho "Chimecho").

In this room, there are two ways out, other than where you came in. First, take the door on the south end of the room by walking up some stairs and accessing the corridor heading leftward beyond it. Through that door, you will find yourself in a little nook of the initial area of Victory Road. You'll be, able to find some all-valuable **Rare Candy** there, as well as a **Max Revive** if you search the nearby rock.

Then head to the northern part of the water and use Waterfall to climb up. Before heading up, detour to the right for another battle. Ace Trainer Henry uses one Pokémon: a level 49 [Honchkrow](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Honchkrow "Honchkrow"). Head up the waterfall and then to the left. On the pieceo of land, Dragon Tamer Andre will challenge you with his level 49 [Gabite](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Gabite "Gabite"). Head to the water on the right and go down the waterfall to grab TM59 Dragon Pulse. Go back up this waterfall and round to the left. Surf down to the south and take the stairs in the west to another room.

Then, use the other (third) door out of the previous room to access another part of the primary room of Victory Road (be sure to search the rock near the door to the next area for a **Big Mushroom**).

From here, it's relatively smooth sailing. There's only a couple of trainers remaining, and more items to grab. Begin by heading leftward down the corridor you find yourself on, taking out Veteran Edgar's three Pokémon en route. His pokemon include a level 45 [Tentacruel](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Tentacruel "Tentacruel"), a level 46 [Golem](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Golem "Golem"), and a level 48 [Empoleon](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Empoleon "Empoleon"). Then, swing south to find the **Razor Claw** once at the end of the leftward-headed pathway. Back near Veteran Edgar's position, head south. Climb up the rockface with Rock Climb, and then head left over the bridge and through another door. This will lead you to another previous area of the cave, where another isolated item in **TM79** can be found. Then, backtrack all the way to where you last used Rock Climb, and climb back down to the main area.

Behind Veteran Edgar is a staircase. Take that up and then go right over the bridge that goes over the area below (a place where you can walk). You won't be able to proceed through the door there (the person guarding it simply won't allow it), but you will be able to acquire some **Zinc** clearly sitting on the ground nearby. Now, we're ready to leave! Head back down and under the bridge, and this time head right. Use Rock Climb to reach the area above, and fight the final trainer of the area: Dragon Tamer Clinton. He uses three pokemon two level 46 [Gibles](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Gible "Gible") and a level 46 [Gyarados](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/Gyarados "Gyarados"). After taking him on, you can simply head north and then west out of the cave. Congratulations! You've reached [The Pokémon League](/wikis/pokemon-diamond-version/The_Pokemon_League "The Pokémon League") building!
